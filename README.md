### Kinetic proofreading

The codes used for the model of kinetic proofreading and the in-silico evolution for speed of a random Markov network. General functions used across the Python notebooks are defined modularly in the Python codes and loaded in each notebook. The data used to make the paper figures can be downloaded from [] and loaded in the notebooks. 

### Self-assembly

### Growth curves analysis

Code used to get the growth rate of the yeast strains with different DNA polymerases as function of 3-AT. The raw growth assay data (OD6000) used for the analysis can be found in the same folder. 

### Plotting the data from the Supplementary Table of Ravikumar et al. 2018

The notebook used for plotting and looking at the data reported in Table 2 of the Supplementary Material of Ravikumar et al. _Cell_ **175** 2018, as well as a reformatted version of Table 2. The reformatting is necessary to be able to load the data with pandas.
